GIVIN a recipe search website
WHEN I open the website
THEN I am greeted with a title, a search bar, my search history, and a bunch of random(?) recipes
WHEN I click on a recipe
THEN I am brought to a more detailed description of that recipe including ingredents and steps for preperation
WHEN I type in the search bar
THEN different auto-complete answers appear under the search bar
WHEN I search for a recipe
THEN It is saved to my search history
THEN I am brought to a more detailed recipe for whatever I searched
WHEN I click the "nutrition" button on a recipe
THEN I can see the nutritional value of that meal
